### About Us - Unified AI

Ivy is both an ML transpiler and a framework, currently supporting JAX, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Numpy.

Ivy unifies all ML frameworks :boom: enabling you not only to write code that can be used with any of these frameworks as the backend, but also to convert :arrows_counterclockwise: any function, model or library written in any of them to your preferred framework!

You can check out [Ivy as a transpiler](https://github.com/unifyai/ivy#ivy-as-a-transpiler) and [Ivy as a framework](https://github.com/unifyai/ivy#ivy-as-a-framework) to learn more about this, try out Ivy straight away going through the [Setting up Ivy](https://github.com/unifyai/ivy#setting-up-ivy) section, or dive deep into Ivy's [Documentation](https://github.com/unifyai/ivy#documentation) and [Examples](https://github.com/unifyai/ivy#examples)!

If you would like to contribute, you can join our growing [Community](https://github.com/unifyai/ivy#community) :earth_africa:, check out our Contributing guide, and take a look at the open tasks if you'd like to dive straight in :technologist:

# Assignment

## Contribute to our [PaddlePaddle](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle) Frontend Functions!

### Task instructions üìù

In this task, you will contribute one PaddlePaddle [Front-end function](https://unify.ai/docs/ivy/overview/deep_dive/ivy_frontends.html) that will become a part of the Ivy master branch. This would involve the following steps
- Choose one function from the list of [**open function tasks**](https://github.com/unifyai/ivy/issues/19178)
- [Set up your environment](https://unify.ai/docs/ivy/overview/contributing/setting_up.html) to start working with Ivy
- Implement the function using the Ivy framework
- Implement the corresponding test for the function (to know where to place each of those files, refer to [our documentation](https://unify.ai/docs/ivy/)!)
- Commit and make a PR to the Main branch for this addition!

Upon approval and subsequent acceptance, your contribution will be attributed to you and added to the Ivy master branch.
